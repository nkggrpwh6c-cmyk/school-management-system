## üìä CURRENT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

After setup, you should have these variables:

```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://postgres:...@...pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
SECRET_KEY = django-insecure-xxx... (MUST CHANGE THIS)
DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = vbcasms.onrender.com,.onrender.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = https://vbcasms.onrender.com
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Bad Request (400)" after setting ALLOWED_HOSTS
**Solution:** Make sure CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS includes `https://`

### Issue: Site won't load after setting SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment, then try https:// (not http://)

### Issue: Login not working after security changes
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Check if cookies are enabled

### Issue: Can't access admin after password change
**Solution:**
1. Try logging in with new password
2. Wait 30 minutes if locked out
3. Contact system admin if still locked

---

## üìû EMERGENCY ACCESS

If you get locked out:

### Option 1: Wait for Lockout to Expire
- Lockouts expire after 30 minutes
- Try logging in again after timeout

### Option 2: Reset via Render Shell (if available on paid plan)
```bash
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

### Option 3: Create New Admin (if critically needed)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## üìà MONITORING

   - Failed login attempts
